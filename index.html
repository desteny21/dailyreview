            <h2 id= #aboutme >About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born on December twenty seventh nineteen ninety nine and in 
                Fresno, California. My hobbies include running and reading, and in my
                family I have my mom and dad who raised me and I have one sister. I 
                dream to one day take a vaccation in Paris, Florida, and Washington D.C. 
                Somewhere i would like to visit one day is Paris because of the distance
                and it is the only place that is not in this country that I want to go to.</p>
            
                <p>My favorite color is a light blue and my favorite animal is a dolphin and whale.
                When I get older I hope to be an actress or a runway model. My favorite places are 
                L.A. because thats the home of the Dodgers and they have a lot of amusement parks. </p>
